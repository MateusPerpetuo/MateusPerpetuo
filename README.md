### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ heres a litle more about me.

Despite having a degree in advertising, my career has taken me in a different direction. I've been working as a video editor for several years specializing as a colorist and 3D compositor, honing my skills in visual storytelling and digital manipulation. 

While I've enjoyed the creative challenges and technical complexities of this work, I've also become increasingly aware of how important programming is in the film and media industries. I've always been fascinated by the behind-the-scenes processes that bring movies and TV shows to life, so I'm excited to dive into the world of software development and maybe be using my experience in color grading and compositing to create cutting-edge tools and technologies. With my keen attention to detail, artistic sensibility, and desire to innovate.

I'm excited to start this new adventure and see where it takes me. 


Starting right now I'm going to publish here the project that I developed during my studies. 


If you have any tips or comments to make, please feel free to make them.
